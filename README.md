# Archive Pages

Websites for your archives, served directly from your archive.org item.

## How it works

Step 1: Add an archive.org item

Step 2: Upload the archive of your website as a zip file

Step 3: Add an `archive.yml` file mentioning the zip file path

Here is an example of `archive.yml` file:

```
version: 1
itemtype: website
root: archive.zip
```

Your archive pages will be available at `https://<itemname>.onarchive.org/`

## Example
